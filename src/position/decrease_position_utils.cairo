/// The decrease_position function decreases the size of an existing position
/// in a market. It takes a UpdatePositionParams object as an input, which
/// includes information about the position to be decreased, the market in
/// which the position exists, and the order that is being used to decrease the position.
///
/// The function first calculates the prices of the tokens in the market, and then
/// checks whether the position is liquidatable based on the current market prices.
/// If the order is a liquidation order and the position is not liquidatable, the function reverts.
///
/// If there is not enough collateral in the position to complete the decrease,
/// the function reverts. Otherwise, the function updates the position's size and
/// collateral amount, and increments the claimable funding amount for
/// the market if necessary.
///
/// Finally, the function returns a DecreasePositionResult object containing
/// information about the outcome of the decrease operation, including the amount
/// of collateral removed from the position and any fees that were paid.
