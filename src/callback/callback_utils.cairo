//! Most features require a two step process to complete
//! the user first sends a request transaction, then a second transaction is sent
//! by a keeper to execute the request.
//!
//! To allow for better composability with other contracts, a callback contract
//! can be specified to be called after request executions or cancellations.
//!
//! In case it is necessary to add "before" callbacks, extra care should be taken
//! to ensure that important state cannot be changed during the before callback.
//! For example, if an order can be cancelled in the "before" callback during
//! order execution, it may lead to an order being executed even though the user
//! was already refunded for its cancellation.
//!
//! The details from callback errors are not processed to avoid cases where a malicious
//! callback contract returns a very large value to cause transactions to run out of gas.
