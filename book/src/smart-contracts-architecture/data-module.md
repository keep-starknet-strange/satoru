## Data Module

The Data Module serves as the backbone for storing and managing the protocol's data. Below is a detailed outline of its constituents and their respective functions and responsibilities.

### Smart Contracts

The `DataStore` is the central smart contract of the module, holding the responsibility of maintaining the protocol's data. It manages different entities, including orders, positions, withdrawals, and deposits.

##### Key Features & Responsibilities:
- **Order Management:** Enables the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of orders, each linked to a specific user account. Orders can be retrieved using their unique keys or can be listed per user account.
  
- **Position Management:** Manages financial positions associated with user accounts, offering functionalities to manipulate and view positions individually or by user account.
  
- **Withdrawal Management:** Supports the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of withdrawal requests, and enables the listing of withdrawals by user account.
  
- **Deposit Management:** Manages user deposits, allowing the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of deposits, viewable individually or listed by user account.

- **Market Management:** Facilitates the addition, deletion, and retrieval of markets, managing market indexes and ensuring that only authorized users can perform these operations.
  
- **Oracle Functions:** Allows setting and getting token IDs, with stringent access controls, ensuring only authorized entities can access them.
  
- **Access Control and Security:** Implements rigorous access control mechanisms, ensuring that only authorized addresses can perform certain operations. Specific role controls are applied, allowing only addresses with the `CONTROLLER` role to perform sensitive modifications to the contractâ€™s state.

##### Constructor
The constructor initializes the contract with a `role_store` address, establishing the access control and role management mechanism from the deployment of the contract.

### Cairo Library Files

This Cairo library file plays a crucial role in generating the keys for the protocol's entries in the data store. The keys serve as unique identifiers, enabling the protocol to accurately access and manage the stored data.
