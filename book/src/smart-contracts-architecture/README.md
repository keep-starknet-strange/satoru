# Smart contracts architecture

In this section, we will go through the smart contracts architecture.

Satoru is composed of several modules. Each module is a set of smart contracts and libraries that are related to a specific area.

The goal of this architecture is to make the code more readable and maintainable, as well as to make it easier to add new features.

Another goal is to enable composability. For example, the `Role` module can be used in any other module to add role-based access control to the module's functions.
