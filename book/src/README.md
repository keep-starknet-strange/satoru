Like it's namesake, Gojo is **powerful** and **badass**. It's also a bit of a mystery. We don't know what it's capable of yet, but we're excited to find out.

Combine the power of **Starknet** with it's huge computation capacity to the great design of **GMX v2**, and you get Gojo, a synthetics platform that is fast, cheap and scalable.
