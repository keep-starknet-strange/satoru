# Prerequisites

There are several ways to run Satoru:
- Install prerequisites on the local system
- Run in a dev container

## Installation on the local system
- [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html)
- [Starknet Foundry](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/)

## Run in a dev container
Dev containers provide a dedicated environment for the project. Since the dev container configuration is stored in the `.devcontainer` directory, this ensures that the environment is strictly identical from one developer to the next.

To run inside a dev container, please follow [Dev Containers tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial).
