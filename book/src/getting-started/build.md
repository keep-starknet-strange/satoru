# Build the contracts

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```shell
scarb build
```

This will build the smart contracts into `target` directory.

Sample output:

```shell
tree target/dev
target/dev
├── satoru.starknet_artifacts.json
├── satoru_DataStore.sierra.json
└── satoru_RoleStore.sierra.json
```
